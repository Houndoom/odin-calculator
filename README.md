# Houndoom's calculator

JavaScript calculator created for Odin Project. The calculator does not evaluate more than a single pair of values at a time, hence order of operations is not applicable.

Keyboard support is also available for digits and operations (except '00'). Press Backspace to Clear and Delete to All Clear. The memory functions and +/- button do not have keyboard shortcuts.
